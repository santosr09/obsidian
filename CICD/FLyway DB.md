### Migration types
Migrations can either be versioned or repeatable. 
- **versioned** : Has a unique version and is applied exactly once. 
- **repetable** : Doesnâ€™t have a version. Instead, they are (re-)applied every time their checksum changes.

Within a single migration run, repeatable migrations are always applied last, after pending versioned migrations have been executed. Repeatable migrations are applied in order of their description. For a single migration, all statements are run within a single database transaction.
