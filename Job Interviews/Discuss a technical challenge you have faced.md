In my previous Job, I was in charge to decide with technology/approach, use to achieve the task assigned, The task consisted in to expose the features of a web application(Stock trading), we were required to expose the features as an API which would be consumed by a Mobile App, we didn't have too much time to implement the solution, and the process to add a new tech stack in the company(Bank) it was bureaucratic; the main web application which contained all the features was developed using Struts2,  so I decided to use a Struts plugin to expose the features in a new API, this reduced the learning curve and didn't require approvals to use a new Stack as opposed to if I had decided to use another RESTful.

I think one of the most challenging tasks has been the coordination to solve some application/infraestructure vulnerabilities, because it required communication with global teams, researching what could be the solution, which patches or upgrades will be required, raising the tickets for the Production support team to install the required patches or upgrade the components, and asking the Hacker team to retest the application/infrastructure. And verify that the application was not impacted.
