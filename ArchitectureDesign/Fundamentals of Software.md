### Architecture Versus Design
architect is responsible for things like analyzing business requirements to extract and define the architectural characteristics (“-ilities”), selecting which architecture patterns and styles would fit the problem domain, and creating components (the building blocks of the system). The artifacts created from these activities are then handed off to the development team, which is responsible for creating class diagrams for each component, creating user interface screens, and developing and testing source code.

Architects should focus on technical breadth so that they have a larger quiver from which to draw arrows. Developers transitioning to the architect role may have to change the way they view knowledge acquisition. Balancing their portfolio of knowledge regarding depth versus breadth is something every developer should consider throughout their career

FROZEN CAVEMAN ANTI-PATTERN
A behavioral anti-pattern commonly observed in the wild, the Frozen Caveman Anti-Pattern, describes an architect who always reverts back to their pet irrational concern for every architecture. 
 Thinking like an architect requires overcoming these “frozen caveman” ideas and experiences, seeing other solutions, and asking more relevant questions.

### Analyzing Trade-Offs
> Architecture is the stuff you can’t Google.

_Everything_ in architecture is a trade-off, which is why the famous answer to every architecture question in the universe is “it depends.”

The decision between different solutions will always depend on the business drivers, environment, and a host of other factors.

The point here is that _everything_ in software architecture has a trade-off: an advantage and disadvantage. Thinking like an architect is analyzing these trade-offs, then asking “which is more important: extensibility or security?”
