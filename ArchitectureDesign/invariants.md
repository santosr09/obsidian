invariants are constraints
invariant means something that should stick to its conditions no matter whatever changes or whover uses/transforms it.

A set of assumptions a piece of code takes before it is able to perform any computation of importance. And if those assumptions aren’t actually true the result of the computation is meaningless, or more appropriately, it cannot be guaranteed that the result is correct.

Invariant, quite literally, means _something that does not change or vary_

**Invariants hence directly relate to the correctness of a program.**
