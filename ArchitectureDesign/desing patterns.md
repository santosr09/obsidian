Avoid for desing, better as communication tool
Not to use from the beging, design your soultion, and in the process you will be realising what patterns your solution could be matching

Patterns allow you to say more with less. 
You are communicating not just a pattern name but a whole set of qualities, characteristics, and constraints that the pattern represents.
